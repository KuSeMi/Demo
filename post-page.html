                <p class="h5-my4"><strong>Why do so many startups use Ruby on Rails?</strong></p>
                <p>Startups choose Rails because it fits the mode of operations of Startups. A Rails team can often demonstrate more progress sooner than they could with more "formal" environments.This comes at the cost of long-term sustainability of the rate of progress. A startup will begin to sink under the cost of its own Rails implementation. The cost of features will rise precipitously as the ratio of rework to new work (a key product development metric that startups often fail to track) rises. Delays will also lengthen at a time when the cost of delay (or, the need to turn work around faster due to market attention) increases.The choice of Rails is the choice to turn on the afterburners immediately after coming off the deck - and leave them on. More progress will be made earlier, but the fuel will be burned off much faster.You don't choose Rails to go far, you choose Rails to go fast - at the cost of going far. You need a technical exit plan if you choose Rails. Many teams and managers don't grasp this fine point, and underestimate how quickly to afterburners will consume the reserves - and so at an accelerating rate.You have to know that you'll get an infusion around the time that you'll have burned off your reserves. This is true of any environment - not just Rails - that allows shortcuts to be taken.Rails is a set of shortcuts. If you have a solid grasp of both software structural physics and principles of product development, you can leverage Rails knowingly.Rails is a Hail Mary pass. You pull out that play only when you've got no other choice. Startups usually don't have a choice. They have to demonstrate progress faster than what may be sane and sustainable. Ironically, this is the antithesis of Lean, which is not focused exclusively on fast feedback, but also (and perhaps principally) on the longer term. Note, I'm talking about Lean here, not Lean Startup.Unfortunately, many startups don't make this choice consciously, and end up not only struggling to continue to make progress, but not understanding the physics of why its happening. And because of the intensity of publicity built up around Rails in the past few years, wondering whether Rails' inherent effects on software structure and the effects of software structure on productivity is often something that doesn't happen.Startups choose Rails because startups often operate in a constant state of schedule crisis. Every week is often an all-or-nothing proposition, and merely surviving is the all-consuming burden. In those conditions, Rails offers a set of software shortcuts that gives survival a fighting chance.However, a startup that remains perpetually in crisis is merely a startup in perpetual crisis. It can't last unless it gets very popular around the time that it needs a significant influx.Startups choose Rails because Rails is a meaningful, short-term, seed stage schedule optimization. They often stay with Rails because they don't know how to get themselves out of Rails, or when to get out of Rails. And unfortunately, they often ride it right into the ground.Startups choose Rails either because they're making a conscious decision along a timeline with a good technical plan, or because they don't know any better. In the case of the later, the survival of the company becomes more a matter of chance and circumstance than any methodical or voluntary action on the account of its managers and workers.</p>
